# FDF

This is my first graphic project on the mlx library.
The program reads a .fdf file with coordinates and colors (optional), then it draws a color 3D image. Using the keyboard, you can rotate the picture in three planes, increase the size of the picture, the height along the Z axis, and change the position on the screen. The mouse can additionally adjust the size along the Z axis
